Aim

The package is supposed to have the following functionalities:

    We should be able to interactively add New Starlings to a Flock with variabe attributes
    Given a Flock, we zshould be able to simulate their movement vis-a-vis various Internal and External Forces
    We should also be able to calculate the instantaneous power and force on each Starling, and check if these values are in a sane range

The package structure for the software package is as follows:
Engineering Drawing Software
|
|-> bin
|-> release
|-> doc
|-> forms
|-> include
|-> screen
|-> src
|-> lib
  |-> conf
  |-> features
  |-> modules
  |-> Plugins
  |-> Win32

Following is the description of the directories:

    bin : Object files for the executable
    release : Contains the main executable 
    doc : Documentation and related files
    forms : Contains the form descriptors for UI purposes
    include : Contains all header files for the project
    screen : some screens showing different features
    src : source (C++, XML) files developed for the software
    lib : contains standard header files not created by the owners of this repository 

Qt and OpenGL

The Model has been developed using Qt and OpenGL libraries. These are not required to be installed, as the executable is statically linked and deployment ready. This is not a cross-platform software and is built to run on Windows.
Compilation and execution instructions

In the top directory run:

make

(In case this does not work, statically linked executable in Release directory can be used)
